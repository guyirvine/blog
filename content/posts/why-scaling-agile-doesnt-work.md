# Why Scaling Agile Doesn't Work

Lead time - "The time from Golf Course to Measurable Customer Outcome"

Value Stream Maps

The single most important unknown is whether the project will be canceled. The second is will people us it.

We need to run early experiments to find out if people are going to use it.

What is the cost of _not_ delivering this feature.

Most of the time, we build the wrong thing, so
What we should do,
1. don't optimize for the case where we are right
2. focus on value, no cost
3. create feedback loops to validate assumptions
4. make it economic to work in small batches
5. enable an experimental approach to product development

Users don't know what they want. They know what they don't want once you've built it form them.

Impact Mapping

Minimize output, maximize outcome.

Hypothesis-driven delivery
We believe that,
  [building this feature]
  [for these people]
  will achieve [this outcome]
We will know when we are successful when we see
  [this signal from the market]

Don't fight stupid, make more awesome
