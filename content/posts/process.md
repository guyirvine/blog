## Word Bites

    1. "We need to change our mindset to view our proposed solution to a problem statement as a hypothesis"
    2. "We do not do projects anymore, only experiments."
    3. "The key outcome of an experimental approach is measurable evidence and learning."
    4. "By combining Continuous Delivery and Hypothesis-Driven Development we can now define working software and validated learning as the primary measures of progress.
    5. "Hypothesis-Driven Development is a great opportunity to test what you think the problem is, before you work on the solution."

## Template

    Hypothesis
    ----------
    We believe [doing this]
    for [these people]
    will achieve [this outcome/impact]

    Experiments
    -----------
    We will test these assumptions by ...

    Validation
    ----------
    We will know this hypothesis is valid if by [date] we see

    Quantitative measurable outcome / Qualitative measurable outcome

## Scientific Method

The steps of the scientific method are to:

1. Make observations
2. Formulate a hypothesis
3. Design an experiment to test the hypothesis
4. State the indicators to evaluate if the experiment has succeeded
5. Conduct the experiment
6. Evaluate the results of the experiment
7. Accept or reject the hypothesis
8. If necessary, make and test a new hypothesis
